# The Berm

## Description
The Berm was built using a Node and Express.js web server. It is backed by a MySQL database and ORM Sequelize. We utilize both GET and POST requests to retrieve and post data to our API. The application is successfully deployed to Heroku and can be found by navigating to the link below. Our design structure follows the MVC paradigm and we implemented the UI Kit library to deliver a polished front end.
